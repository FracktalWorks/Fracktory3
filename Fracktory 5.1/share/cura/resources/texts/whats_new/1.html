<h4>Increased segment resolution and better surface quality</h4>
<p>We have improved the resolution algorithm for all our users, and tuned it for users of S-line printers running firmware version 7.0.3 or above. This means that smooth shapes will print with up to twice as many segments resulting in a smoother surface and better overall surface quality.</p>
