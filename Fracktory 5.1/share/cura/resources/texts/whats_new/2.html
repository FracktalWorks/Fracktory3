<h4>Improved supports when using Ultimaker support materials</h4>
<p>We have improved both the speed and quality of supports printed with the Ultimaker PVA and Ultimaker Breakaway support materials, resulting in faster prints, more reliable support structures and improved surface quality on the part of your print that is being supported. Print times when using these new support structures can be as much as 20% faster. The shape of the new supports will also make PVA supports easier to dissolve, especially when using the <a href="https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/pva-removal-station">Ultimaker PVA Removal Station</a>.</p>
